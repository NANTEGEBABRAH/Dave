                <p style="color: black; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I am Naka, the students cook. I highly appreciate the school for the efforts it has done to impart morals in the children. This is the first school that i have worked for as a cook but the students treat you as a mother and also grade you to be a teacher also. The students are indeed living christ-like lives.</p>

                <p style="color: purple; font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">well,its rare for a government school to have an ambassador, but its the passion for the school that I saw my Mom hold for this school. Mum has always yarned to own a school of her own but she failed to because the much passion for City Of Faith couldnt let her leave her students for a new environment. And for this case, I plegded to provide what so ever is within my reach to help the school grow and also develop, so that my Mom never feels bad that she is not owning a her own school. I chose to become an ambassador of the school to help Mom's school where need be because, the government doesnt provide enough for all the government schools.</p>

                <p style="color:black;">Honestly, I happened to first listen to my son's testimonial, the ambassador, and all that he said is right. He spoke all from my mouth, and I highly appreciate his efforts for sure. i also appreciate fellow staff for co-operating with me to bring back the school to the top. How can I forget the students,,, they practice the christ-like lives they are taught and that's best I want from a student in my school. I highly reccommend you to come and join the school even in times when I shall be shifted to another government school, because the foundation that has been built is a strong one that no other person can break</p>
